// to do:
// 1. make method that upon character selection, the characters not selected 'move' to the 
// 'Enemies Available To Attack' row
// 2. make a method that changes the color of the 'border' 
// 3. make method that, upon clicking thte 'Attack' button, decrements the defender's HP by an increasing amount--use a data 
// attribute that is updated when the attacker attacks. this value increases until the game
// is over. the damage dealt to the defender is displayed at the bottom of the defender's pic.
// 4. make method that upon when the player's hp <= 0 the game ends and everything resets.
// 5. make method that resets on '.on('click') 
// 6. make method that when the defender is clicked, the defender 'moves' to the defender row & the color changes.

// $('#one').on('click' function() {
// 	alert('hi');
// }
